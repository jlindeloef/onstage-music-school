### About the website
## Project planning
Before start planing I needed to view music school website to look at it from a users point of view.
I visited a varying of websites and notice what I thought was working and what was not working. Also after working on my diploma I learned many things to bring to my project.
I also want to be clear that this is a fictional school! I want to have a distinct website with necessary information to make a dicision, as a user- What do I need to know to sign up?
I started build up a structure in Balsamic to get a sence of what it could be.

## Targeting
