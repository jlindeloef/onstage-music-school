## About the website
### Project planning
Before start planing I needed to view music school website to look at it from a users point of view.
I visited a varying of websites and notice what I thought was working and what was not working. Also after working on my diploma I learned many things to bring to my project.
I also want to be clear that this is a fictional school! I want to have a distinct website with necessary information to make a dicision, as a user- What do I need to know to sign up?

I started build up a structure in Balsamiq to get a sence of what it could be. The structure is very basic though I wanted to use images as background and did`nt decide the colours from under the process.
Here is my Balsamiq wireframe: [Onstage Music School](https://github.com/jlindeloef/onstage-music-school/blob/main/assets/images/Onstage%20music%20school.pdf)

### UX
This website are for mainly parents or guardianÂ´s who want to sign up their children to a music school.

### Users stories
- As a user I want to know what kind of website I am on.
- As a user I want to navigate easy and quickly through the website.
- As a user I want to know which instruments they have.
- As a user I want to find out the prizing of the courses.
- As a user I want to have an easy and distinct sign up.
For the users, I wanted to give them a good overview of Onstage Music School, focusing on the courses and sign up.

### Website structure
The website has four sections:
**Home/About us:** I combined these two Sections mostly because of layout on the page. 
**Courses:** A clear view of the courses the school has to offer and also prizing.
**Sign up:** A sign up form to send to school with name, phonenumber, email and wich instrument/instruments that are in interest.
**Footer:** With contact information and links to social media.

## Style
**Background:**I decided to use a darkyellow background on the navigation section and the "About Us" section. I tried different variants of colour but found this as a working colour with the dark image in the logo and the white background colour from the "Courses" section below. The logo background is an image that I found suiting for the schools visions and philosophy. The "Courses" section, as i mention has a white background with content in boxes with borders as same darkyellow colour used before. The "Sign up" section has an image as background that I found as a good choice and the footer has the darkyellow colour.

**The colors used was:**
+ Darkyellow rgb(196, 174, 133- for background.
+ White #FFF -used for the background and text.
+ Black #000- For text and shadows.
+ Turquoise #81cfd4- For the apply button.

### Technologies
1. HTML - To create a basic site
2. CSS - To create a nice, standout front-end and to give a great user experience
3. Balsamiq - To create a wireframe

### Features to Implement
Further there could be a gallery with images and videos from concerts and lessons.

## Testing
+ I tested the site, and it works in different web browsers: Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.
+ On mobile devices, I tested the my site on a Samsung Galaxy A13 with the Samsung browser and an iPhone SE with the Safari browser.
+ I confirmed that the site is responsive and functions on different screen sizes using the devtools device toolbar.
+ I confirmed that the navigation and the sections Home/About us, Courses and Sign up are readable and easy to understand.
+ I confirmed that the form works: it requires entries in every field, only accepts an email in the email field, and the submit  button works.

### Validator Testing
+ HTML No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
+ CSS No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator

### Testing using Google Lighthouse:
I used Google Lighthouse via devtools to assess the website.

  ### Bugs
+ Solved bugs
  - A column gap settings expanded the width outside the page but my mentor helped me solve it with flexbox properties.
+ Unsolved bugs
  - The fixed navigation bar covered the content when dropping down to the choosen section. I solved it by linking the navigation bar links a bit higher up on the page then it actually should be. This can be a little noticed in some screensizes.
 
  ## Deployment
+ The site was deployed to Git Hub pages using the following steps:
+ After logging into GitHub I located my repository for my Portfolio Project 1.
+ I then clicked the "Settings" button at the top of my repository
+ Under General, navigate to Code and Automation and select "Pages".
+ In the Build and Deployment section for Source, select 'Deploy from a branch' from the drop-down list.
+ For Branch, select "main" from the drop-down list and "/root" in the next bar and Save.
+ On the top of the page, the link to the complete website is provided.
+ The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch.
