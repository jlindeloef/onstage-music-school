## About the website
### Project planning
Before start planing I needed to view music school website to look at it from a users point of view.
I visited a varying of websites and notice what I thought was working and what was not working. Also after working on my diploma I learned many things to bring to my project.
I also want to be clear that this is a fictional school! I want to have a distinct website with necessary information to make a dicision, as a user- What do I need to know to sign up?

I started build up a structure in Balsamiq to get a sence of what it could be. The structure is very basic though I wanted to use images as background and did`nt decide the colours from under the process.
Here is my Balsamiq wireframe: [Onstage Music School](https://github.com/jlindeloef/onstage-music-school/blob/main/assets/images/Onstage%20music%20school.pdf)

### UX
This website are for mainly parents or guardianÂ´s who want to sign up their children to a music school.

### Users stories
- As a user I want to know what kind of website I am on.
- As a user I want to navigate easy and quickly through the website.
- As a user I want to know which instruments they have.
- As a user I want to find out the prizing of the courses.
- As a user I want to have an easy and distinct sign up.
For the users, I wanted to give them a good overview of Onstage Music School, focusing on the courses and sign up.

### Website structure
The website has four sections:
**Home/About us:** I combined these two Sections mostly because of layout on the page. 
**Courses:** A clear view of the courses the school has to offer and also prizing.
**Sign up:** A sign up form to send to school with name, phonenumber, email and wich instrument/instruments that are in interest.
**Footer:** With contact information and links to social media.

(Style
Background: It was decided after some deliberation not to have a background image running behind the content as this was both distracting and made the content look more cluttered. The decision to leave the background color as white happed towards the end of the design phase when the content had been style and it was decided that this was the most minimalistic and legible approach.

Color: The white background was chosen as it enabled the content to be very legible and to stand out for the user, making the site more navigatable.

The colors eventually selected for use were;

White #FFF -used for the background.
Grey #D3D3D3 -used for hover over functions and detailing.
Teal #008080 -used for heading, sub-headings and buttons.
Black #000 -used for text as black on white is widely known as the most legible combination of colors.
The white background helped the banner images and images in the gallery page to pop out as well as heightening the pop of color in the icon used.)

### Technologies
1. HTML - To create a basic site
2. CSS - To create a nice, standout front-end and to give a great user experience
3. Balsamiq - To create a wireframe

## Features to Implement

### Testing
+ I tested the site, and it works in different web browsers: Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.
+ On mobile devices, I tested the my site on a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra with the Samsung browser and an iPhone SE with the Safari browser.
+ I confirmed that the site is responsive and functions on different screen sizes using the devtools device toolbar.
+ I confirmed that the navigation and the sections Home/About us, Courses and Sign up are readable and easy to understand.
+ I confirmed that the form works: it requires entries in every field, only accepts an email in the email field, and the submit  button works.

## Validator Testing
+ HTML No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
+ CSS No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator

  ### Bugs
+ Solved bugs
  - A column gap settings expanded the width outside the page but my mentor helped me solve it with flexbox properties.
+ Unsolved bugs
  - The fixed navigation bar covered the content when dropping down to the choosen section. I solved it by linking the navigation bar links a bit higher up on the page then it actually should be. This can be a little noticed in some screensizes.
